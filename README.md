Project Euler Solutions
==========

My solutions to Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) problems, using Python as my weapon of choice. This repo has three main purposes:

- To show my coding style and the way I approach problems in Python
- To invite input on my solutions and hopefully offer insight to anybody struggling with a problem
- To push myself to further explore the power of Python through the problems

Enjoy!
