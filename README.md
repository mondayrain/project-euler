Project Euler Solutions
==========

My solutions to Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) problems, using several different languages. This repo has three main purposes:

- Use Project Euler to explore and learn each new language
- To show my coding style and the way I approach problems in each language
- To invite input on my solutions and hopefully offer insight to anybody struggling with a problem

Enjoy!
